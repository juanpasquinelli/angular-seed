# Angular seed
This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS application.

The seed contains AngularJS libraries, along some AngularJS plugins. It also contains a Gruntfile.js file with a bunch of preconfigured tasks, so you don't have to worry about build, development server or setting up a test runner.

The seed also provides a setup file that will take care of installing all the dependencies for the seed to run.
